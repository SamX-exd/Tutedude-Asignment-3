# Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python 
#Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 



> Description

This program calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function in Python.
The user inputs a number, and the program returns its factorial using a base case and recursive calls.

> What is Factorial?

The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

Example:
Factorial of 5 = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

> How the Program Works

.Takes an integer input from the user

.Uses a recursive function called factorial()

.Defines a base case to stop recursion

.Returns the calculated factorial value

> How to Run the Program

.Make sure Python is installed on your system

.Clone this repository or copy the code

.Run the file using:

.(python filename).py


> Enter a number when prompted

 Sample Input
Enter the number: 5

 Sample Output
120

> Concepts Used

.Functions

.Recursion

.User Input

.Conditional Statements

> Note

This program works for positive integers. Handling of zero or negative numbers can be added as an improvement.

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations


> Description

This Python program demonstrates how to use the built-in math module to perform common mathematical calculations such as square root, logarithm, and sine of a given number.

The program takes a number as input from the user and displays the calculated results.

> Operations Performed

- The program calculates:

.Square Root using math.sqrt()

.Logarithm (natural log) using math.log()

.Sine using math.sin()

> How the Program Works

.Imports the math module

.Accepts an integer input from the user

.Applies mathematical functions on the input

.Prints the results in a readable format

> How to Run the Program

.Ensure Python is installed on your system

.Clone the repository or copy the code file

.Run the program using:

.python filename.py


.Enter a number when prompted

> Sample Input
Enter a number: 9

> Sample Output
Square root of 9 is : 3.0
Logarithm of 9 is : 2.1972245773362196
Sine of 9 is : 0.4121184852417566

> Concepts Used
