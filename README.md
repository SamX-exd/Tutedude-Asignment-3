#Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 

> Description

This program calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function in Python.
The user inputs a number, and the program returns its factorial using a base case and recursive calls.

> What is Factorial?

The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

Example:
Factorial of 5 = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

> How the Program Works

.Takes an integer input from the user

.Uses a recursive function called factorial()

.Defines a base case to stop recursion

.Returns the calculated factorial value

> How to Run the Program

.Make sure Python is installed on your system

.Clone this repository or copy the code

.Run the file using:

.(python filename).py


> Enter a number when prompted

 Sample Input
Enter the number: 5

 Sample Output
120

> Concepts Used

.Functions

.Recursion

.User Input

.Conditional Statements

> Note

This program works for positive integers. Handling of zero or negative numbers can be added as an improvement.
